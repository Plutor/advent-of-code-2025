I am doing [Advent of Code 2025](http://adventofcode.com/2025).
I also did [some of 2024 in Typescript](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2024),
[some of 2023 in Scala](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2023),
[some of 2022 in Haskell](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2022),
and actually [finished 2021 in Kotlin](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2021).

I am learning [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) from scratch, and using [ZeroBraneStudio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/).

# Learnings

* "The operator ~= is the negation of equality." What have I done to myself?
* "It is customary in Lua to start arrays with index 1." _What have I done to myself?!_
